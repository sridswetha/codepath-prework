## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Duolingo: 
  - i like how for each character there's a distinct voice to make learning interesting
  - the tips feature is great cause it provides hints and explanations when I'm stuck during a lesson
- Spotify:
  -  queueing is great because I can choose songs that I want to hear at the moment in the order that I want to 
  -  i like the smart shuffle feature in which songs similar to the ones in my playlist are additionally included
- Google Calendar:
  -  being able to move around the events across different dates is really useful
  -  color coding different events is great

An app that I might wanna build: It can be frustrating to identify the song behind a trending audio, as the audio names often don’t include the song title and may instead display the user’s name. Additionally, it’s easy to forget the exact name of a song, so to search for is sometimes an effort that's sometimes fruitless. While apps like Shazam can identify songs from audio, they’re less effective with humming. An ideal solution would be an app that organizes trending audios by categories such as month or trend and leverages AI to recognize hummed melodies. It could also suggest relevant trending audios based on descriptive user input, such as “the audio where they moonwalk and shuffle backward.”


## Notes

- Had issues with connecting button to UI logic but resolved it after adding an IBOutlet an IBAction for the button
- Had issues with displaying gif in readme (resolved, I had to click on image address from the image posted on imgur)
